The Bref Dashboard will soon come out of beta, read more about [the v1.0 launch here](https://github.com/brefphp/dashboard/blob/main/Launch.md).

## 2023-01-02

You can now read the changelog in the app!

## 2022-12-03

You can now search secrets.

When there are no databases in the application (i.e. the current stack), the "databases" page now shows all databases of the same region.

Added a button to reload AWS credentials, e.g. when SSO tokens have expired.

## 2022-12-02

Logs for a single invocation were broken in some situations. This should now be fixed!

Regions were also re-organized in the home view to put the most popular regions first.

Users do not have to be allowed to list CloudFormation stacks anymore. In that case, [they will be prompted to add stacks by name](https://twitter.com/matthieunapoli/status/1382017987939553280). This is great for teams that don't want to give broad permissions to everyone.
