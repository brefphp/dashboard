Hi everyone!

I am happy to say that after 2 years in beta, the Bref Dashboard will finally launch as a stable product!

_More details about Bref Dashboard in the landing page: [dashboard.bref.sh](https://dashboard.bref.sh/)._

Some of you have been using it daily, and I want to thank you for your trust and support. Now that the beta period ends, the product will require a paid subscription of **15â‚¬/user/month**. You will be able to purchase one in the application, or at [dashboard.bref.sh](https://dashboard.bref.sh/) (after the launch).

I understand that having to pay for something that used to be free isn't the best of news. If you want to switch to the paid subscription, you will be able to use the `LAUNCH` coupon at checkout to get 50% off the first month.

The Bref Dashboard will play an important role in making Bref (the open-source project) a long-term and viable project. It will also help me allocate more time on maintaining and adding new features to the application. If you are curious, you can learn more about the strategy behind the launch in this video: https://youtu.be/uHHuOim0zt0

I would love to hear your feedback or questions: shoot me an email: matthieu@bref.sh.
