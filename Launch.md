Hi everyone!

I am happy to say that after 2 years in beta, the Bref Dashboard is finally released as a stable product!

_More details about Bref Dashboard in the landing page: [dashboard.bref.sh](https://dashboard.bref.sh/)._

Some of you have been using it daily, and I want to thank you for your trust and support. Now that the beta period has ended, the product requires a paid subscription of **15â‚¬/user/month**. You can purchase a license at [dashboard.bref.sh](https://dashboard.bref.sh/).

I understand that having to pay for something that used to be free isn't the best of news. If you want to switch to the paid subscription, you can use the `LAUNCH` coupon at checkout to get 50% off the first month.

The Bref Dashboard will play an important role in making [Bref](https://bref.sh/) (the open-source project) a long-term and viable project. It will also help me allocate more time on maintaining and adding new features to the application.

I would love to hear your feedback or questions: shoot me an email: matthieu@bref.sh.
